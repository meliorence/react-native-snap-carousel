If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you a are certain this is a new, unreported bug, you can submit a bug report by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/issues/new).

:warning: When doing so, you need to fill out the [issue template](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/blob/master/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md). **This step is mandatory!** Not doing so will result in your issue getting closed. Don't take this personally if this happens, and feel free to open a new issue once you've gathered all the information required by the template.

* **One issue, one bug:** Please report a single bug per issue.
* **Provide reproduction steps:** List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. Provide a Snack, share the relevant source code or upload a sample project to GitHub. We should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.
* **Provide a Snack and/or a screencast:** The best way to get attention on your issue is to provide a reduced test case. You can use [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) to demonstrate the issue. More often than not, providing a screencast will also be of tremendous help to understand the matter at stake (a screenshot may sometimes be enough).
* **Try out the latest version:** Verify that the issue can be reproduced locally by updating your project to use [the latest commit from `master`](https://github.com/archriss/react-native-snap-carousel/#using-a-specific-commit). The bug may have already been fixed! Also make sure to test the latest stable release of React Native as your issue could be linked to RN's core.
